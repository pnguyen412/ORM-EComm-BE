# ORM-EComm-BE

## Description
- The main objective of this challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying the given starter code.
- In addition to the above, we were tasked with configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL DB.
- I learned how to use the await operator inside an async function to properly fire off my code.
- I also learned how to work with objects from multiple js files and working with api routing.

## Installation:
- Clone the repository on github locally. After being successfully cloned, files are editable through VSC.

## Usage:
- Use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.
- Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name.
- Use npm start in command line to initialize the application
- Open Insomnia or a similar program to perform CRUD operations
