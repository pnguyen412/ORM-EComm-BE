# ORM-EComm-BE

## Description
- The main objective of this challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying the given starter code.
- In addition to the above, we were tasked with configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL DB.
- I learned how to use the await operator inside an async function to properly fire off my code.
- I also learned how to work with objects from multiple js files and working with api routing.
